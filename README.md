   - Delivery person's current location
   - Restaurant location
   - Customer's delivery address

2. **Priority Assignment**:
   - Orders are automatically assigned to the nearest available delivery person
   - If the closest person rejects, the system tries the second closest
   - Continues until an available person accepts or all options are exhausted

3. **Real-time Updates**:

   - Order status changes are reflected immediately
   - All users see live updates

- Downtown, Midtown, Upper East Side, etc.
- Only receive orders from selected areas
- Can change areas at any time
